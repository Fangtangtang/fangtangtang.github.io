    A Chinese painting featuring lotus infused with elements inspired by Dunhuang "Feitian". This piece received First Prize at the 2024 SJTU Nanyang Calligraphy & Painting Competition.  
    Although only a close-up is shown here, the complete work can (hopefully) still be found on display in ZhiYuan College at SJTU.  
    **Fun fact**: The competition theme was "Surpass", and I originally intended to call it 《携手超越》 "Together, We Surpass".
