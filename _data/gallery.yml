    Floral paintings created with watercolor using traditional Chinese painting techniques.  
    **Fun fact**: These were my first paintings made in the US, created with the Chinese brush I brought from home and watercolor paints and paper purchased here.

    A calligraphic work featuring the character "福" (fortune), created as a 2024 New Year blessing for ACM Class. The gold-painted elements blend traditional symbolism with contemporary design: a dragon motif on the left, while the right side incorporates creative letterforms with the ACM class emblem.  
    The letterforms are inspired by artist [XU BING](https://www.xubing.com/cn)
